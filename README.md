# DataPrivacyAndSecurity
All of the projects and homework I done about data privacy and security.

Project-2 includes the implementations of the following protocols, mechanisms, and error values:

- Optimized Unary Encoding (OUE) Protocol
- Generalized Randomized Response (GRR) Protocol
- RAPPOR Protocol
- Exponential Mechanism
- Laplace Mechanism
- Mean Squared Error
- Average Error
- Histogram Plotting
- Noisy Histogram Plotting

- Project2 also includes the Benchmark analysis on the GRR,RAPPOR,and OUE protocols.
